Welcome to the wonderful world of geometry!

For a beginner, I'd recommend starting with some basic shapes that are easy to understand and visualize. Here are a few:

1. **Square**: A square is a great shape to start with, as it has four equal sides and four right angles (90-degree angles). It's symmetrical and easy to draw.
2. **Circle**: A circle is a simple, continuous curved shape that's easy to understand. It's defined by a single curved line that is equidistant from a central point (the center).
3. **Triangle**: A triangle is another fundamental shape in geometry. It's a polygon with three sides and three angles. You can start with a simple equilateral triangle (all sides equal) or a right triangle (one 90-degree angle).
4. **Rectangle**: A rectangle is similar to a square, but with four sides of unequal length (two pairs of equal sides). It's a great shape to learn about properties like area and perimeter.

These shapes will give you a solid foundation in geometry and help you understand more complex concepts as you progress.

Which one of these shapes would you like to explore further? Or do you have a specific aspect of geometry in mind (e.g., angles, symmetry, measurements)?
