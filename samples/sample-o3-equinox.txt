Spain, like the rest of the Northern Hemisphere, has two equinoxes every year:

Spring (vernal) equinox – around 20 March
Autumn (fall) equinox – around 22 or 23 September
Those are the dates practically every year; very rarely they can slip to 19 March or 21 September.

If you want the exact moment for the current year (2024):

Peninsular Spain & Balearic Islands (Madrid time = CET in winter, CEST in summer)
• Spring equinox: Wednesday 20 March 2024 at 04:06 CET
• Autumn equinox: Sunday 22 September 2024 at 14:44 CEST

Canary Islands (UTC-1 relative to mainland)
• Spring equinox: 03:06 WET
• Autumn equinox: 13:44 WEST

The equinox happens at the same instant worldwide; only the local clock time changes with the time zone.
