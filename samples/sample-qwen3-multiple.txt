**For someone just getting into geometry:**  
Start with **basic shapes** that form the foundation of geometric understanding! Here’s a playful guide:  

1. **Triangles** (especially equilateral or right triangles) – They’re simple, versatile, and great for learning angles, sides, and the Pythagorean theorem.  
2. **Circles** – Master the concepts of radius, diameter, circumference, and area. They’re everywhere in nature and design!  
3. **Squares and Rectangles** – Perfect for understanding symmetry, perimeter, and area.  
4. **Polygons** – Once you’re comfortable with basics, explore pentagons, hexagons, or even complex shapes like star polygons.  
5. **3D Shapes** (cubes, spheres, pyramids) – For a fun challenge, dive into volume and surface area.  

*Pro tip:* Use hands-on tools (like tangrams, compasses, or even pizza slices!) to visualize shapes. Geometry is all about **playful exploration**—so get into it! 🎨📐

**For making the most of time-consuming tasks (shampoo, burial, etc.):**  
Life’s chores and heavy moments can feel like drudgery, but here’s how to find meaning in them:  

1. **Mindful Micro-Moments**:  
   - *Shampoo*: Focus on the *scent*, *texture*, and *ritual* of cleansing. Turn it into a mini meditation.  
   - *Burying a relative*: Honor the person’s memory by reflecting on their impact. Let the task be a sacred act of love.  

2. **Reframe the "Empty" Tasks**:  
   - See mundane work as a **chance to practice patience** or **connect with the Earth** (e.g., gardening, cooking).  
   - For tough tasks (like grief), allow yourself to *feel* the weight without rushing. Healing is a process.  

3. **Efficiency + Intention**:  
   - Streamline repetitive tasks (e.g., batch-buy shampoo) to free up mental space.  
   - For big moments (like a funeral), focus on **what matters**: connection, closure, or legacy.  

4. **Find the Light**:  
   - Even in darkness, there’s a lesson. A burial might teach you about impermanence; a shampoo choice might spark creativity.  

**Final thought**: Time and effort aren’t just things to endure—they’re the raw materials for meaning. Whether you’re solving a geometry problem or navigating life’s curveballs, ask: *What can I learn here?* 💡  

*And remember: Even the most mundane shapes (like a square) can become a masterpiece with the right perspective. 🌟*
