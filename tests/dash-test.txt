Testing various dash formats and spacings:

1. Em-dash with no spaces—like this example.
2. Em-dash with spaces — like this example.
3. En-dash with no spaces–like this example.
4. En-dash with spaces – like this example.
5. This is a range: 1–10 (should stay as en-dash)
6. Word—word (em-dash between words)
7. Word — word (em-dash with spaces)
8. Word–word (en-dash between words)
9. Word – word (en-dash with spaces)

Multiple  spaces    should   be   collapsed   properly.
    But indentation at the start of lines should be preserved.
        And code blocks too.

Certainly! Let me help you with your question.
