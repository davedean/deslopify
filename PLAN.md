# Implementation Plan for Deslopifier

## Overview
The Deslopifier will be a utility that cleans up text by removing or translating common "slop" patterns (unnecessary or non-standard characters and phrases) into cleaner output.

## Core Components

1. **Character Replacements**
   - Replace emdash/endash with regular dashes with spaces
   - Replace non-standard spaces with regular spaces
   - Implement a character mapping system for easy addition of new replacements

2. **Phrase Removals**
   - Remove phrases like "Certainly! " at the start of text
   - Remove phrases like "Honestly; " at the start of text
   - Implement a phrase removal system for easy addition of new patterns

3. **Processing Pipeline**
   - Create a modular pipeline architecture that:
     - Takes input text
     - Applies character replacements
     - Applies phrase removals
     - Returns cleaned text

4. **CLI Tool**
   - Implement command-line interface that accepts:
     - Text via stdin
     - Text via file input
     - Output to stdout or file

5. **Library Interface**
   - Create a clean API for programmatic use
   - Implement configuration options for customizing replacements

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up project structure
2. Implement character replacement module
3. Implement phrase removal module
4. Create processing pipeline to combine these modules
5. Build CLI interface
6. Write tests for all components
7. Add documentation
8. Package for distribution

## Future Enhancements

1. Allow for user-defined replacement/removal patterns
2. Add regex support for more complex replacements
3. Create a configuration file format for persistent settings
4. Add context-aware replacements
5. Implement batch processing for multiple files
6. Add bullet point and list formatting standardization
7. Improve handling of date/time formats
8. Add special character preservation for technical/scientific content
9. Implement smart handling of abbreviations and time zones
10. Add language-specific rules for non-English content
